This contines the files used to make the rain noise sample

I downloaded a rain noise file from some website, made two copies of it back-to-back, cross-faded them together, then cut both in the same place so that they'll loop perfectly.

Input audio file, downloaded from some website I found googling, I don't remember where: [rain-02.wav](rain-02.wav)

Output audio file, this is the file loaded to the SD card: [RAINLP1.WAV](RAINLP1.WAV)

Audacity project: [Rain Noise Loop.aup3](Rain Noise Loop.aup3)
