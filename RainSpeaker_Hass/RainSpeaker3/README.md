# Rain Speaker 3

[rain_speaker_3.yaml](rain_speaker_3.yaml) has the yaml file that needs to be placed in home assistant in `homeassistant/packages`

Be sure to also be importing packages. I figured this out from [here](https://github.com/geappliances/home-assistant-adapter/blob/main/doc/getting-started.md)

I'm using this by having a couple scripts that just set the volume to 0 for off and 70 for on, then I set up some buttons on a dashboard for on and off.
